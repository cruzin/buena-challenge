# A quick multistep form

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

It also used react-multistep, which I learned in the course of this coding challenge, is not very good.
It is not very flexible, and it is not very well documented. 
I would not recommend using it in production, or at all, really. 

If you do not immediatly review this coding challenge, it is VERY possible that I will have replaced it with a better solution.


## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm install`
to install all the dependencies.
You might notice there are 8 vulnerabilities (2 moderate, 6 high), but they are not actual vulnerabilities,
as they would not be exploitable even if this could go to prod (to verify run npm audit --production))


### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.


### `npm run e2e-tests`
to run cypress e2e and component tests in the cypress window. They do component tests now :)

### `npm run e2e-tests-headless`
to run cypress e2e and component tests headlessly in the terminal.
